# Diophantine Equation-Related Algorithms

## Motivation:
During the Fall semester of 2023, I enrolled in MUSA 154: Diophantine Equations, a student-led mathematics course at UC Berkeley instructed by Nir Elber. As part of the course assignments, I implemented the following algorithms via Python, with reference to the course lecture notes.

## Featured Algorithms:
Finite continued fraction expansion algorithm, Magic Box Algorithm, Pell equation solution finder, reduced binary quadratic form finder, and an algorithm relating to Henselâ€™s Lemma.
